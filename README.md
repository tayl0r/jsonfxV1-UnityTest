jsonfxV1-UnityTest
==================

test project for Unity3d 4.x + JsonFX 1.x
(the project is named incorrectly, in the source code it's named testColliders but that is just because there's really no good way to rename a project in Unity).

In the past couple weeks JsonFX has broken for me on iOS devices (still works fine in the Editor). I think it might be caused by the latest version of Unity.

I am uploading this simple test project so others can test it on their own devices / versions of Unity.
