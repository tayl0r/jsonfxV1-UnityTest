jsonfxV1-UnityTest
==================

test project for Unity3d 4.x + JsonFX 1.x

In the past couple weeks JsonFX has broken for me on iOS devices (still works fine in the Editor). I think it might be caused by the latest version of Unity.

I am uploading this simple test project so others can test it on their own devices / versions of Unity.
